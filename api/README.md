# Back-End API vs OPENAI GPT-4 API integration

## Description
This project is a Role Play text game based on OpenAI GPT-4. The project is divided into two parts: the back-end API and the front-end client. The back-end API is responsible for handling the game logic and communication with the OpenAI GPT-4 API. The front-end client is responsible for displaying the generated game to the user and sending user input to the back-end API.
